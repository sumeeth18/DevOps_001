#different types of variables 
# syntax <variable name> = variable
# variable name should always starts with alphabets,if want to give spaces then it should be in "_" eg a= 20, a_b=20
#initial variable name are not allowed with Special characters and numbers  
a = 20 # valid and variable value is integer(In python data types are automatically analysed)
b = 3.15 # valid and variable value in floating
c = 'value' #string value should always be in '' or ""
d = False #boolean value
e = None # Null Value

#type is built in function to know the type of value

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(d)
